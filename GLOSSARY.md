# Entrepreneur
There are many definitions of an entrepreneur, but this quote describes what we like best: “The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It’s as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.” –Nolan Bushnell, entrepreneur.

# Market Size
Market size is a measure of how big “your market” is. It's the answer to “How many customers can you potentially get?"

# Market Validation
Market Validation is an event that happens when the “market buys/uses your product". We use the term Customer Validation in the Playbook, but it’s mostly interchangeable.

# MAUs
Monthly Active Users. A common metric that venture capitalists as for.

# Startup Accelerator
Startup Accelerators are 3 to 6 month programmes that help you move swiftly in your startup journey. The best time to get into an accelerator is when you already have a prototype or early customers as accelerators can help you increase the pace of getting customers through their network and connections. Accelerators also help you get noticed by early stage investors and give you a good platform to launch your product. The YCombinator Accelerator at Silicon Valley sets the Gold Standard. The way most accelerators work is that they give you a fixed amount of money, space and their resources in exchange for a fixed amount of equity.
